### Introduction
- **Guessing Game**
  - Everyone choose a number between $[0,\ 100]$.
  - The one whose number is close to $\frac{2}{3}$ of the average win.
  - If you assume all other people choose the average of the range, i.e., $50$, then you may choose $50\times \frac{2}{3}\approx 33$. If you assume all other people have thought about this, i.e., they will choose $33$, then you may choose $33\times \frac{2}{3}= 22$, and so on.
  - Another prospective: the answer cannot exceed $100\times \frac{2}{3}\approx 67$, similarly we can repeat the process to get $67\times \frac{2}{3}\approx 45$, $45\times \frac{2}{3}=30$, and so on.
  - ==Both ways of thinking will derive $0$ ultimately, but choosing $0$ must not be the optimal strategy.==

- **Concepts in Game Theory**
  - Players: $N = \{1,\ \cdots,\ n\} $
  - Actions: $a = (a_1,\ \cdots,\ a_n) \in A = A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n$
  - Payoff function (or utility function): $u_i:A \to \mathbb{R}$ for player $i$
  - Example
    - Prisoner's Dilemma
    ![](image/2022-02-16-11-07-15.png)
    where action $C$ means "Cooperate" while $D$ means "Defect". The numbers in each cell are payoffs (the former one is the payoff of Person 1 and the latter is the payoff of Person 2).
    - There are 2 players in this example.
    - $A_1=A_2=\{C,\ D\}$, $A=A_1\times A_2=\{(C,\ C),\ (C,\ D),\ (D,\ C),\ (D,\ D)\}$
    - $u_1(a)=\begin{cases}
      2, & a=(C,\ C) \\
      0, & a=(C,\ D) \\
      3, & a=(D,\ C) \\
      1, & a=(D,\ D) \\
    \end{cases}$, $u_2(a)=\begin{cases}
      2, & a=(C,\ C) \\
      3, & a=(C,\ D) \\
      0, & a=(D,\ C) \\
      1, & a=(D,\ D) \\
    \end{cases}$

- **Best Response**
  - Denote $a_{-i}=<a_1,\ \cdots,\ a_{i-1},\ a_{i+1},\ \cdots,\ a_n>$ which is others' actions for player $i$. Now $a=(a_i,\ a_{-i})$.
  - ==Definition==
  $a_i^{*} \in BR(a_{-i})\ \text{iff}\ \forall a_i \in A_i,\ u_i\left( \left( a_i^{*},\ a_{-i} \right)  \right)\geqslant u_i\left( \left( a_i,\ a_{-i} \right)  \right)  $
<br>

- **Nash Equilibrium**
  - ==Definition==
  $a\ \text{is a Nash equilibrium iff}\ \forall i,\ a_i \in BR(a_{-i})$
  - Example
    - Still consider the Prisoner's Dilemma described above.
    - If $a=(C,\ C)$, $a_1$ is not a best response and $a_1^{*}$ should be $D$.
    - It is similar for $a=(C,\ D)$ and for $a=(D,\ C)$.
    - If $a=(D,\ D)$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ are both best response. Hence, $(D,\ D)$ reaches Nash equilibrium.
