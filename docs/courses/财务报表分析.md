![](image/2022-02-18-21-34-40.png)

### Types of Activities
- Financing Activities
  - Raising cash from investors and returning cash to investors.
- Investing Activities
  - Investing cash raised from investors in operational assets. For example, 
    - Research and development (R&D) expenditures
    - Additions to property and equipment
    - ...
- Operating Activities
  - Utilizing investments to produce and sell products.

### Firm Valuation
- Formula
  $$
  \text{Value of the Firm} = \text{Value of Debt} + \text{Value of Equity}
  $$
- Example
  ![](image/2022-02-18-22-52-32.png)
  - You may think the answer is just the sum of the numbers listed by using the formula above. However, the value of equity does not equal to stockholder's equity which is a book value.
  - The value of debt is just $\$8,406+\$14,512=\$22,918 \text{ million}$ while the value of equity is $\$41\times 2,126 \text{ million} = \$87,166 \text{ million}$
  - Thus, the enterprise market value is $\$22,918+\$87,166=\$110,084 \text{ million}$

### Anchoring Valuation
- Formula
  $$
  \text{Value} = \text{Anchor} + \text{Extra Value}
  $$
- Example
  - A firm reports book value of shareholders' equity of $\$850 \text{ million}$ with $25 \text{ million}$ shares outstanding. Those shares trade at $\$45$ each in the stock market. An analyst values the equity by setting the book value as an anchor. She calculates extra value of $\$675 \text{ million}$. Should she issue a buy or a sell recommendation to her clients?
  - The analyst evaluates the equity value as $\$850 \text{ million} + \$675 \text{ million} = \$1,525 \text{ million}$. Under this valuation, the price of the stock should be $\frac{\$1,525 \text{ million}}{25 \text{ million}}=\$61$, which is higher than the current price. Thus, she should issue a buy recommendation.

> However, the accuracy and timeliness of the earnings forecasts are not as important as we think among the factors affecting analysts' compensation. Instead, the most important things are: your industry knowledge, your standing in analyst rankings or broker votes, your accessibility and responsiveness, and your professional integrity.

## Chapter 2: Introduction to the Financial Statements

    $\text{Cash}$

    $+ \text{ Other Assets}$

    $- \text{ Liabilities}$

    $\overline{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad}$

    $\text{Shareholders' Equity}$
- <mark>Cash Flow Statement</mark>
  - $\text{Change in Cash} = \text{Cash from Operations} + \text{Cash from Investing} + \text{Cash from Financing}$
- <mark>Statement of Shareholders' Equity</mark>
  - $\text{Ending Equity} = \text{Beginning Equity} + \text{Comprehensive Income} - \text{Net Payout to Shareholders}$
  - $\text{Comprehensive Income} = \text{NI} + \text{Other Comprehensive Income}$
  - $\text{Net Payout to Shareholders} = \text{Dividends} + \text{Share Repurchases} - \text{Share Issues}$
- <mark>Income Statement</mark>

- Example
  - From the following information for the year 2012, calculate the ending equity under GAAP rules (R&D expenses are expensed as incurred), for a company with shareholders' equity at the beginning of 2012 of \$3,270 million. Amounts are in millions.
    > GAAP is used in America, while IFRS is the international version. China uses a version closed to IFRS.

    ![](image/2022-02-25-22-23-18.png)
  - $\text{Gross Margin} = \$4458 - \$3348 = \$1110$
    $\text{EBIT} = \text{Gross Margin} - \$1230 - \$450 = \$(-570)$
  - Note that the number in the parentheses means negative number. Thus, we have $\text{NI} = \text{EBIT} - \$(-200) = \$(-370)$.
    > A loss yields a tax benefit that the firm can carry forward to reduce future taxes.
  - $\text{Comprehensive Income} = \text{NI} + \$76 = \$(-294)$
    $\text{Net Payout} = \$140 - \$680 = \$(-540)$
    $\text{Ending Equity} = \$3270 + \text{Comprehensive Income} - \text{Net Payout} = \$3516$

### Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)
- $\text{Market Premium} = \text{Market Value of Equity} - \text{Book Value of Equity}$
  $\text{P/B} = \frac{\text{Market Value of Equity}}{\text{Book Value of Equity}}$
- $\text{Intrinsic Premium} = \text{Intrinsic Value of Equity} - \text{Book Value of Equity}$
  $\text{Intrinsic P/B} = \frac{\text{Intrinsic Value of Equity}}{\text{Book Value of Equity}}$
- Book Value Measurement
  - Historical Cost Accounting
  - Fair Value Accounting
- Median-Level Comparison between China and US
  ![](image/2022-02-26-10-11-37.png)
  The reasons that P/B in China is higher than that in US should be organized into 2 aspects: <mark>overestimated price and underestimated book value</mark>. Overestimated price may result from the <mark>short-selling constraints</mark> and underestimated book value may be related to the omitted <mark>shell value</mark>.
- Industry Comparison
  ![](image/2022-02-26-10-17-14.png)
  Price is about expectation, which means industries like Information Technology and Health Care have higher P/B due to the imagination of their development (high R&D expenses), while industries like Utilities and Financials have lower P/B (close to 1 in US) because of their limited development.

### Price-to-Eearnings Ratio (P/E)
- $\text{Trailing P/E} = \frac{\text{Price}}{\text{Most Recent annual EPS}}$
- $\text{Rolling P/E} = \frac{\text{Price}}{\text{Sum of EPS for most recent 4 quarters}}$
- $\text{Forward P/E} = \frac{\text{Price}}{\text{Forecast of Next Year's EPS}}$
- $\text{Dividend-Adjusted P/E} = \frac{\text{Price}+\text{Annual DPS}}{\text{EPS}}$ (Dividends affects prices but not earnings)

## Chapter 3: How Financial Statements Are Used in Valuation

### Simple Schemes for Valuation
- The Method of Comparables
  - Assume some characteristics of 2 similar firms are equal, then we can estimate a firm's value by anchoring the other one.
- Screening on Multiples
  - Multiple Sorting
- Asset-Based Valuation
  - Estimate the firm's assets and substracts the value of debt.

### Valuation Models
- Discounted cash flow (bond, NPV, etc)
- CAPM

## Chapter 4: Cash Accounting, Accrual Accounting, and Discounted Cash Flow Valuation

### DDM (Dividend Discount Model)
- Advantages
  - Easy concept: dividends are what shareholders get.
  - For a frim with a fixed payout ratio, dividends are predictable at least in the short run;
- Disadvantages
  - Dividends payout is not related to value. A company can borrow to pay dividends;
  - Forecast horizons should be long. For firms without a fixed payout ratio, the forecasts are unreliable.

### DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Model
$$
\text{Free Cash Flow (FCF)} = \text{Operating Cash Flow (OCF)} - \text{Capital Expenditure (CAPX)}
$$
- Advantages
  - Easy concept: cash flow are "real" and easy to think about; they are not affected by accounting rules;
  - Similar to NPV.
- Disadvantages
-
