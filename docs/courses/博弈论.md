## Introduction

### Guessing Game
- Everyone choose a number between $[0,\ 100]$.
- The one whose number is close to $\frac{2}{3}$ of the average win.
- If you assume all other people choose the average of the range, i.e., $50$, then you may choose $50\times \frac{2}{3}\approx 33$. If you assume all other people have thought about this, i.e., they will choose $33$, then you may choose $33\times \frac{2}{3}= 22$, and so on.
- Another prospective: the answer cannot exceed $100\times \frac{2}{3}\approx 67$, similarly we can repeat the process to get $67\times \frac{2}{3}\approx 45$, $45\times \frac{2}{3}=30$, and so on.
- <mark>Both ways of thinking will derive $0$ ultimately, but choosing $0$ must not be the optimal strategy.</mark>

### Concepts in Game Theory
- Players: $I = \{1,\ \cdots,\ n\} $
- Actions: $a = (a_1,\ \cdots,\ a_n) \in A = A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n$
- Payoff function (or utility function): $u_i:A \to \mathbb{R}$ for player $i$
- Example
  - Prisoner's Dilemma
  ![](image/2022-02-16-11-07-15.png)
  where action $C$ means "Cooperate" while $D$ means "Defect". The numbers in each cell are payoffs (the former one is the payoff of Person 1 and the latter is the payoff of Person 2).
  - There are 2 players in this example.
  - $A_1=A_2=\{C,\ D\}$, $A=A_1\times A_2=\{(C,\ C),\ (C,\ D),\ (D,\ C),\ (D,\ D)\}$
  - $u_1(a)=\begin{cases}
    2, & a=(C,\ C) \\
    0, & a=(C,\ D) \\
    3, & a=(D,\ C) \\
    1, & a=(D,\ D) \\
  \end{cases}$, $u_2(a)=\begin{cases}
    2, & a=(C,\ C) \\
    3, & a=(C,\ D) \\
    0, & a=(D,\ C) \\
    1, & a=(D,\ D) \\
  \end{cases}$

### Best Response
- Denote $a_{-i}=<a_1,\ \cdots,\ a_{i-1},\ a_{i+1},\ \cdots,\ a_n>$ which is others' actions for player $i$. Now $a=(a_i,\ a_{-i})$.
- <mark>Definition</mark>
$a_i^{*} \in BR(a_{-i})\ \text{iff}\ \forall a_i \in A_i,\ u_i\left( \left( a_i^{*},\ a_{-i} \right)  \right)\geqslant u_i\left( \left( a_i,\ a_{-i} \right)  \right)  $

### Nash Equilibrium
- <mark>Definition</mark>
$a\ \text{is a Nash equilibrium iff}\ \forall i,\ a_i \in BR(a_{-i})$
- Discrete Example
  - Still consider the Prisoner's Dilemma described above.
  - If $a=(C,\ C)$, $a_1$ is not a best response and $a_1^{*}$ should be $D$.
  - It is similar for $a=(C,\ D)$ and for $a=(D,\ C)$.
  - If $a=(D,\ D)$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ are both best response. Hence, $(D,\ D)$ reaches Nash equilibrium.
- Continuous Example
  - Price Competition
    - 2 restaurants with prices $P_x$ and $P_y$.
    - Num of customers for each restaurant: 
    $$
    Q_x = 44 - 2P_x + P_y \\
    Q_y = 44 - 2P_y + P_x
    $$
    - Cost of serving each customer is $8$.
    - Each restaurant's goal is to maximize its profit.
    - They set prices simultaneously.
  - Since the quantity functions are the same form, 2 restaurants are <mark>substitute</mark>.
  - The profit of restaurant $x$ is 
  $$
  \Pi_x = (P_x-8)(44-2P_x+P_y)=-2P_x^2+(P_y+60)P_x-8(P_y+44)
  $$By letting $\frac{\partial \Pi_x}{\partial P_x}=0$ (first order condition), we get the best response function for $x$: 
  $$
  P_x^{*} = \frac{P_y+60}{4} = \frac{P_y}{4} + 15
  $$Similarly for $y$, the best response function is $P_y^{*} = \frac{P_x}{4} + 15$.
  - According to the definition of Nash equilibrium, the prices should satisfy 
  $$
  \begin{cases}
    P_x = \frac{P_y}{4} + 15 \\
    P_y = \frac{P_x}{4} + 15 \\
  \end{cases}
  $$which means $(P_x^{*},\ P_y^{*})=(20,\ 20)$.

### Method of Scoring
- Control $a_{-i}$ and underline the best response of $i$.
  - Example
    - Street Garden Game
    Emily, Nina and Talia have to choose simultaneously whether to contribute toward the creation of a flower garden for their small street.
    ![](image/2022-02-23-15-19-18.png)
    where numbers in each cell represent their utility respectively.
    - The Nash equilibrium is that they all choose to not contribute.

## Dominated Strategies

### Dominance
- Strict Dominance
  - Strategy $\overline{s}_i \in S_i$ is strictly dominated if there is <mark>some</mark> strategy $\hat{s}_i \in S_i$ s.t. $u_i((\hat{s}_i,\ s_{-i}))>u_i((\overline{s}_i,\ s_{-i}))$ for each $s_{-i} \in S_{-i}$.
- Weak Dominance
  - Strategy $\overline{s}_i \in S_i$ is weakly dominated if there is some strategy $\hat{s}_i \in S_i$ s.t. $u_i((\hat{s}_i,\ s_{-i}))\geqslant u_i((\overline{s}_i,\ s_{-i}))$ for each $s_{-i} \in S_{-i}$ and $u_i((\hat{s}_i,\ s_{-i}))>u_i((\overline{s}_i,\ s_{-i}))$ for some $s_{-i}$.
- Example
  - Second Price Auction
    - One indivisible unit of an object for sale.
    - $n$ potential buyers with commonly known valuations $0<v_1<v_2<\cdots<v_{n}$ for the object.
    - Buyers bid simultaneously and each submits bid $s_i \in [0,\ +\infty)$.
    - The bidder with the highest bid wins the auction and pays the second highest bid (if there are several winners, then randomly choose one).
    - Bidder $i$'s payoff ($i=1,\ 2,\ \cdots,\ n$) is given by 
    $$
    u_i = \begin{cases}
      0,& s_i<\underset{j\neq i}{\mathrm{max}}\ s_j \\
      \frac{v_i-\underset{j\neq i}{\mathrm{max}}\ s_j}{k},& s_i=\underset{j\neq i}{\mathrm{max}}\ s_j \\
      v_i-\underset{j\neq i}{\mathrm{max}}\ s_j,& s_i>\underset{j\neq i}{\mathrm{max}}\ s_j
    \end{cases}
    $$where $k$ is the num of winners.
    - Let $r=\underset{j\neq i}{\mathrm{max}}\ s_j$, we can see the choice of $r$ as the actions of buyers except $i$. The game between buyer $i$ and other buyers can be written as the following payoff matrix: 
    ![](image/2022-02-28-09-10-56.png)
    Note that bidding $s_i = v_i$ is a <mark>weakly dominant</mark> strategy even if buyer $i$ does not know others' valuations.

### Method of Eliminating
- We can get Nash equilibrium by eliminating <mark>strictly dominated</mark> strategies iteratively.
- Example
  ![](image/2022-03-02-10-46-34.png)
  - We can easily find that for column player, "Left" and "Right" are both strictly dominated by "Center", which means we can eliminate them. Then, the matrix becomes $3\times 1$ as follows: 
  ![](image/2022-03-02-10-51-15.png)
  - Now we can see that for row player, "Up" and "Down" are both strictly dominated by "Middle". By eliminating these strategies we get the Nash equilibrium ("Middle", "Center").
- However, by eliminating weakly dominated strategies iteratively, we do not always get the Nash equilibrium (order matters).

## Nash Equilibrium: Existence, Multiple Equilibria and Mixed Strategies

### Existence
A Nash equilibrium exists in game $\Gamma_{n}=\{I,\ \{S_i\},\ \{u_i(\cdot)\}\}$ if $\forall i \in I$, 
- $\{S_i\}$ is a nonempty, convex and compact (closed and bounded) subset of some Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{M}$;
- $u_i(s)$
