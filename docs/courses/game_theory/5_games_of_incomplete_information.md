### Games of Incomplete Information

#### Example: Cournot with Uncertain Demand
Recall the [Cournot Equilibrium](courses/game_theory/3_nash_equilibrium.md#cournot-equilibrium) we have discussed before. In the previous discussion, the inverse demand function is fixed. Now we assume there is uncertainty on the demand and the inverse demand function becomes 
$$
P(Q) = k - Q
$$where $k$ is a random variable that $k=1$ with probability $\mu$ and $k=2$ with probability $1-\mu$.

Furthermore, we assume that firm 1 has done some market research and thus has learned the value of $k$ while firm 2 has no information about this. The strategy of firm 1 is $q_{L}$ if the demand is low, i.e., $k=1$
