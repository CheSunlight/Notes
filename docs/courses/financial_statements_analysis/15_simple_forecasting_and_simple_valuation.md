# Chapter 15: Anchoring on the Financial Statements: Simple Forecasting and Simple Valuation

### A Simple Valuation Model
We have value the operations in [Chapter 14](courses/financial_statements_analysis/14_value_of_operations.md#valuation-of-operationsa-modification-to-re-model), then we can derive a simple valuation model: 
$$
V_t^{\text{E}} = \text{CSE}_t + \text{PV of ReOI}
$$

When calculating <abbr title='Present Value'>PV</abbr> of <abbr title='Residual Operating Income'>ReOI</abbr>, we may assume there is a growth <abbr title='Net Operating Assets'>NOA</abbr>. Since we have 
$$
\text{NOA} = \frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{ATO}}
$$

if <abbr title='Asset Turnover'>ATO</abbr> is constant, then we can replace the growth in <abbr title='Net Operating Assets'>NOA</abbr> by growth in sales.
