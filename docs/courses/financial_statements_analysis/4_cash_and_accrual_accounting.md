# Chapter 4: Cash Accounting, Accrual Accounting, and Discounted Cash Flow Valuation

### DDM (Dividend Discount Model)
Using discounted dividends forecast as valuation.

#### Advantages
- Easy concept: dividends are what shareholders get.
- For a frim with a fixed payout ratio, dividends are predictable at least in the short run.

#### Disadvantages
- Dividends payout is not related to value. A company can borrow to pay dividends.
- Forecast horizons should be long. For firms without a fixed payout ratio, the forecasts are unreliable.

### DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Model
Using discounted <abbr title='Free Cash Flow'>FCF</abbr> as valuation.
$$
\text{Free Cash Flow (FCF)} = \text{Operating Cash Flow (OCF)} - \text{Capital Expenditure (CAPX)}
$$

#### Advantages
- Easy concept: cash flow are "real" and easy to think about; they are not affected by accounting rules.
- Similar to NPV.
- It works best when the investment pattern is such as to produce constant free cash flow or <abbr title='Free Cash Flow'>FCF</abbr> growing at a constant rate.

#### Disadvantages
- <abbr title='Free Cash Flow'>FCF</abbr> does not measure value added in the short run. It fails to recognize value generated that does not involve cash flows.
- Investment is treated as a loss of value, so firms can increase <abbr title='Free Cash Flow'>FCF</abbr> by cutting back on investments, which does not mean value added.

### Reported Cash Flow and Cash Flow in Operations

#### Cash Flow from Operations
Reported <abbr title='Operating Cash Flow'>OCF</abbr> includes interest, which is a financing cash flow, so the actual cash flow from operations should be
$$
\text{Cash Flow from Operations} = \text{OCF} + \text{After-Tax Net Interest Payments}
$$
where 
$$
\text{After-Tax Net Interest Payments} = (\text{Interest Payments} - \text{Interest Receipts}) \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})
$$

#### Cash Investment in Operations
Reported cash investments include net investments in interest bearing financial assets (assets that can generate interest), which is also a financing cash flow, so cash investments in operations should be 
$$
\text{Cash Investment in Operations} = \text{Reported Cash Flow from Investing} - \text{Net Investment in Interest-Bearing Securities}
$$

#### Free Cash Flow
Using the concepts above, the <abbr title='Free Cash Flow'>FCF</abbr> can be calculated by 
$$
\text{FCF} = \text{Cash Flow from Operations} - \text{Cash Investments in Operations}
$$

### Earnings and Cash Flows
$$
\text{Earnings} = \text{OCF} + \text{Accruals}\\
{}\\
\begin{aligned}
 \text{Operating Earnings} &= \text{Earnings} + \text{After-Tax Net Interest Payments}\\
 &= \text{OCF} + \text{Accruals} + \text{After-Tax Net Interest Payments}\\
 &= \text{Cash Flow from Operations} + \text{Accruals}\\
 &= \text{Cash Investments in Operations} + \text{FCF} + \text{Accruals}
\end{aligned}
$$

> [!NOTE]
> OCF is reported, while cash flow from operations is interest-adjusted.
