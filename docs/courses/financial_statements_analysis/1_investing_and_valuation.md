$$

$$

You may think the answer is just the sum of the numbers listed by using the formula above. However, the value of equity does not equal to stockholder's equity which is a book value.

The value of debt is just $\text{\textdollar}8,406+\text{\textdollar}14,512=\text{\textdollar}22,918 \text{ million}$ while the value of equity is $\text{\textdollar}41\times 2,126 \text{ million} = \text{\textdollar}87,166 \text{ million}$

Thus, the enterprise market value is $\text{\textdollar}22,918+\text{\textdollar}87,166=\text{\textdollar}110,084 \text{ million}$

### Anchoring Valuation

#### Formula
$$
\text{Value} = \text{Anchor} + \text{Extra Value}
$$

#### Example
A firm reports book value of shareholders' equity of $\text{\textdollar}850 \text{ million}$ with $25 \text{ million}$ shares outstanding. Those shares trade at $\text{\textdollar}45$ each in the stock market. An analyst values the equity by setting the book value as an anchor. She calculates extra value of $\text{\textdollar}675 \text{ million}$. Should she issue a buy or a sell recommendation to her clients?

The analyst evaluates the equity value as $\text{\textdollar}850 \text{ million} + \text{\textdollar}675 \text{ million} = \text{\textdollar}1,525 \text{ million}$. Under this valuation, the price of the stock should be $\frac{\text{\textdollar}1,525 \text{ million}}{25 \text{ million}}=\text{\textdollar}61$, which is higher than the current price. Thus, she should issue a buy recommendation.

> However, the accuracy and timeliness of the earnings forecasts are not as important as we think among the factors affecting analysts' compensation. Instead, the most important things are: 
> - your industry knowledge
> - your standing in analyst rankings or broker votes
> - your accessibility and responsiveness
> - your professional integrity
