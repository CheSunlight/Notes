## Demand and Supply

### Demand

#### What Affect Demand?
- Price of product
- Income of consumer
- Price of other products
  - Price of subsititutes
  - Price of complements
- ...

#### Demand Function
We simply fix all other factors except price of product, to get a simple linear function to describe the relationship between price and quantity: 
$$
Q_d = c_d - k_d P
$$

where $c_d$ is a constant and $k_d$ is usually bigger than $0$.

The <mark>inverse demand function</mark> is given by 
$$
P = \frac{c_d}{k_d} - \frac{1}{k_d}Q_d
$$

<mark>Since we draw the demand curve with price on the y-axis by default, we actually draw the inverse demand function.</mark>

### Supply

#### What Affect Supply?
- Cost
  - Price of materials
  - Wage
- Price of product
- ...

#### Supply Function
Similar to demand function, the supply function can be simplified to be a linear function: 
$$
Q_s = c_s + k_s P
$$

where $c_s$ is a constant and $k_s$ is usually bigger than $0$.

To draw the supply curve, we also need to get the inverse supply function.

### Analysis of Demand and Supply Curves

#### Movement of Curves
- Move along the line: Price changes
- Shift: Other factors change

#### Market Equilibrium
Intersection of demand and supply curves.

#### Consumer Surplus
We can see the demand curve as an <mark>margin utility</mark> curve for consumers since any point on the curve represents the highest price that consumers would pay for the corresponding quantity. Thus, we have a decreasing margin utility.

<mark>Total utility is the integral of margin utility curve, i.e., the area under the curve</mark>, while the cost of the utility is the price you buy at times the quantity you buy.
